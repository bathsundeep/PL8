# PL8
CS307 Dietary application


Problem Statement

There exist many services which suggest recipes based on what you have in your pantry and refrigerator, and some will even suggest new ingredients for you to buy. However those with certain dietary restrictions, such as diabetes, have trouble finding recipes that meet their restrictions. Because these users can only allow some small quantities of sugar into their diet, PL8 will have a large focus in giving those with dietary restrictions a better solution to finding recipes and living a healthy, happy life.
