# PL8
CS307 Dietary application


Problem Statement

There exist many services which suggest recipes based on what you have in your pantry and refrigerator, and some will even suggest new ingredients for you to buy. However those with certain dietary restrictions, such as diabetes, have trouble finding recipes that meet their restrictions. Because these users can only allow some small quantities of sugar into their diet, PL8 will have a large focus in giving those with dietary restrictions a better solution to finding recipes and living a healthy, happy life. 

HOW TO BUILD:

1. I recommend installing Visual Studio Code, it comes with all the extensions to be able to edit typescript (.ts) files and other files we have, as well as being really lightweight and having integrated Git, so you can pull and push from within the client

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?utm_expid=101350005-28.R1T8FshdTBWEfZjY0s7XKQ.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)

[Install node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

[Install the Git Bash shell, we can run npm commands through here.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  

3. Once you have the project pulled, open the git shell.  
    ```
cd pl8/war/

npm install

npm start
    ```
The dependencies will install and the site should open in an open browser after running npm start.  You can also navigate to the site at localhost:3000 in your browser.
